	   <h3>Do you want to know how to play basketball?</h3>
	     <p>Have you ever wanted to drain a three-pointer or break someone's ankles? "How to Play Basketball" is a full interactive website
	     where people, like yourself, can learn how to be a pro-baller. </p>
	   <h3>Basic Rules</h3>
	     <p>Basketball is a team sport. Two teams of five players each try to score by shooting a ball through a hoop elevated 10 
	     feet above the ground. The game is played on a rectangular floor called the court, and there is a hoop at each end. 
	     The court is divided into two main sections by the mid-court line. If the offensive team puts the ball into play behind 
	     the mid-court line, it has ten seconds to get the ball over the mid-court line. If it doesn't, then the defense gets the ball. 
	     Once the offensive team gets the ball over the mid-court line, it can no longer have possession of the ball in the area in back
	     of the line. If it does, the defense is awarded the ball.</p>
	     <p>The ball is moved down the court toward the basket by passing or dribbling. The team with the ball is called the offense. 
	     The team without the ball is called the defense. They try to steal the ball, contest shots, steal and deflect passes, and 
	     garner rebounds. When a team makes a basket, they score two points and the ball goes to the other team. If a basket, or field
	     goal, is made outside of the three-point arc, then that basket is worth three points. A free throw is worth one point. Free throws 
	     are awarded to a team according to some formats involving the number of fouls committed in a half and/or the type of foul committed. 
	     Fouling a shooter always results in two or three free throws being awarded the shooter, depending upon where he was when he shot. 
	     If he was beyond the three-point line, then he gets three shots. Other types of fouls do not result in free throws being awarded 
	     until a certain number have accumulated during a half. Once that number is reached, then the player who was fouled is awarded a 
	     '1-and-1' opportunity. If he makes his first free throw, he gets to attempt a second. If he misses the first shot, the ball is live 
	     on the rebound.</p>
